# Atlyss.GameLibs

This repo is for generating publicized and stripped assemblies for the game [Atlyss](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2768430).

### This is a fork!

This repo was forked from [Raicuparta/unity-libs-nuget](https://github.com/Raicuparta/unity-libs-nuget).

Original instructions for setting this up can be found there.

### Versioning

To workaround Nuget's semver checks not allowing strings, the versions used are a bit different.

Any patch letter being used will be converted into a number, with no suffix dash, as such:

* Game Version: Beta 1.5.0c
* Nuget Version 1.5.03
